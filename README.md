# SNHU-Operating-Platforms

    - Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    The Gaming Room has an Android game application "Draw It or Lose It", and they wanted to expand their application to other platforms. They wanted me to design the code for their web-app version of their application, as well as documenting the process and recommendations in a Software Design document.
    
    - What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    I believe that I did a good job in documenting the differences between the various platforms. Each platform has strengths and weaknesses, and I tried to cover them all. In addition, I outlined which platform would be the best for hosting the application's server based on their unique strengths and weaknesses.
    
    - What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    Having the design document beforehand provided me a reminder of the various parts of development that I would need to consider. I needed to understand the project's constraints before beginning development, as well as applying the domain model within the code itself.
    
    - If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    I would revise the Development Tools portion of the Software Design Document. I went into this project with the idea of taking "Draw It or Lose It" and having it run in a web browser, but the goal when expanding to other operating platforms was to have a functioning web-app, which is different than a browser-based game. Therefore, my considerations in having browsers to use for testing would probably be removed altogether.
    
    - How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    The user would be the player of the game, and their needs would be to have a smooth and responsive experience when playing the game. I implemented this with my considerations for memory techniques in order to keep the game running well. If we were to forgo the user's needs when designing, the final product would not be user-friendly, which would drive away the target audience (in this case, the players of the game), ultimately wasting the time, effort, and resources put into the development of the game.
    
    - How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    
    I approach the design of anything with careful preparation. A solid Software Design doc paired with detailed structural and behavioral UML diagrams lessens the margin of error when tackling the code portion of the software. In terms of preparation, I think I would take on a similar software app in the same as this one, with a detailed design document and UML diagrams. The domain model and the implementation of the singleton class allowed for this software to work effectively while maintaining the principle of least privelage, so I would attempt to adapt as many of these techniques as possible in a similar application.
